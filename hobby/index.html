<h1> About Me </h1> <!--=A little bit about me -->
<p> I like to travel, try new food and learn about different culture. On my spare time,
  I like to visit places I have never been to around the city. One of the thing I do is
  take the CTA bus that i have never been on before and visit the area around the bus route.
  It makes me learn about the diversity of the city and different culture. If you have some
  question about me, feel free to reach out to me</p>
